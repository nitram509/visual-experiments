Visual Experiments
==================

Moving Text
------------------
Some experiments, how to make a nice text animation.

Micro Font 5x5
------------------
A custom pixel based font which only needs 5x5 pixel per character.
I've used it in some older projects, back in the MS-DOS days ...
Remember when your screen resolution was only 320x200 pixel in total ;-)
